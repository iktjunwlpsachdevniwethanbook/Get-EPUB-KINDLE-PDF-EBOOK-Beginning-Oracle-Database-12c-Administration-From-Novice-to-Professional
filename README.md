Title: Hangul Made Simple

Review: Started takin Tae Kwon Do a few months ago. The Do Chang is founded,owned and operated by Koreans. Learning Korean terminology is part of it. I decided to go further and learn the language. I already had a vocabulary started but decided to learn grammar and better pronunciation. This book is far better than I could have expected and my Korean family is all smiles because of the respect I show their culture. They eve gave me a Korean name. "Go Dong Soo" Thanks for such a great course and taking my learning to the next level. I will be back for more of your products.

Title: Good recourse for beginners
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2016
Review: I'm about half way through the book so far, and I feel like I've used it enough to leave a thoughtful and (hopefully) helpful review. The first thing that you should know is that this probably isn't the best "stand alone" book. It's not a textbook, so it's not going to have everything that you need to learn the language. It IS, however, very helpful for a beginner to gain a lot of basic understanding to the language and how grammar fits Korean sentences together. The information is pretty clearly laid out and is to-the-point. Not a lot of unnecessary confusing topics right off the bat, and then it goes a bit deeper into complex rules later on. It's set up in a format that is really easy for me to follow. I really like this book and will definitely move on to the others as I continue learning the language.

That being said, there are a few things that I would have liked to see, especially in a beginner's book. Some of these are entirely preferential, so if you're okay with these things missing, then that's okay.

Use of a "handwriting" font is extremely confusing. It took about 8 chapters before I felt comfortable reading the Hangul font, and I was often copying down the WRONG spelling due to my complete inability to read that font. I would have liked to see the first chapter or two have both the typical font and the handwriting font for all the words in order to better familiarize the differences between the two fonts. Only occasionally in later chapters are new concepts introduced with the cleaner font, but most new words are in the handwriting font.

Though there are audio files available on the site (which are very useful), they are only of the conversations. This is good for listening practice, but there are a lot of new words introduced in each chapter and (especially as a beginner), you kind of have to guess at what they sound like. There's an in-depth Appendix on pronunciation rules, but very few people will read and retain all the rules, and you often find yourself learning a mispronunciation and can't identify the word if you hear it elsewhere. It'd be nice if on vocab words that have special pronunciation, if there was a bit of a reminder "hey, this looks like this, but is pronounced like this!"

Not enough repetition. Again, totally preferential, but I find myself diligently taking notes through out a chapter, do the 6-10 lines of practice at the end, and then moving on to the next chapter without realizing I'm not ready due to a lack of real structure in the chapter's end. There are lists and lists and lists of vocab words, most of which were not used in the chapter. It'd just be nice to see a bit more repetition, a bit more "work" in order to drive home concepts that were taught during a chapter.

Even with these minor flaws, I still find this to be a helpful book, and I recommend it to anyone learning Korean. It's a valuable source of information and the narration style is comfortable, easy to read (not like a dry textbook).

Edit after finishing the book:
Of all the resources that I've been using for learning the language, this one is definitely my favorite. It explains things pretty well and gives you a bit of cultural insight. Right now I'm just going through again to review each chapter. There are a few things that I'd already forgotten, but the rest of it is really sticking with me. I already purchased the second book, and I'll definitely get the third later on. I'm updating my review from 4 stars to 5 stars. Thanks!

Title: Outstanding! 5 Stars!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2017
Review: I'm using my husband's account to write this review.
My husband is full Korean and we have a 3 year old son. Since my husband works all the time it is up to me to teach him Korean. I speak English (obviously), Spanish and Italian (my ethnicity) and now I'm venturing into Korean.
I have enrolled in classes online and have several books, including the living language complete edition (which is great), however this workbook is absolutely amazing. It's a thick 350+ pages of a wealth of information. The way it's written is as if Billy is your best buddy and he's going to teach you all he knows or so help him God!
He has a website that has free audio downloads to help you with pronunciation. Really it's such a wonderful book and it explains everything about grammar and just a great array of practice work.
Outstanding.

Thank you so much Billy, I can see your dedication and your personality shining through your extensive work!
5 Stars!

Title: Best Korean Study Book EVER
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2019
Review: I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this book. I was born in South Korea but raised here in the US. As I grew up, I forgot a lot of my Korean. It was to the point I couldnâ€™t even really read. Well, last week I decided to purchase this book in order to teach myself Korean (wanted to move up in my career). I have already taught myself Hangul and lots of words I didnâ€™t know! The author does an amazing job explaining every single little thing. As a Korean I didnâ€™t know why certain words were said certain ways, but Iâ€™m finally getting to understand! You really get a proper overview of Korean. This book is really great for a beginner!! If you want to learn Korean or review, THIS IS THE BOOK!
